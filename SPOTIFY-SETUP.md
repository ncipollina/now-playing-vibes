   - Add these **Redirect URIs**:
     - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback/spotify`
     - `https://localhost:5287/callback/spotify` (for client-side auth)
   - Save changes

3. **Development Mode**
   - Your app starts in "Development Mode"
   - This allows up to 25 users to test the app
   - Perfect for team testing!

## Step 4: Add Test Users (Optional)

1. **Go to User Management**
   - In your app dashboard, click "Users and Access"
   - Click "Add New User"

2. **Add Your Co-workers**
   - Enter their Spotify email addresses
   - They'll receive invitations to test the app

## Step 5: Configure Local Development

1. **Create User Secrets (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # In the VibeTracker.Server directory
   dotnet user-secrets set "Spotify:ClientId" "your-client-id-here"
   dotnet user-secrets set "Spotify:ClientSecret" "your-client-secret-here"
   ```

2. **Or Add to appsettings.Development.json**
   ```json
   {
     "Spotify": {
       "ClientId": "your-client-id-here",
       "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret-here",
       "RedirectUri": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/callback/spotify"
     }
   }
   ```

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. **Check App Status**
   - In Spotify Dashboard, verify your app is "Active"
   - Note the number of users (starts at 25 for development)

2. **Test Scopes**
   - We'll need these scopes for the app:
     - `user-read-private` (read user profile)
     - `user-read-email` (read user email)
     - `streaming` (play music in browser)
     - `user-modify-playback-state` (control playback)

## Important Notes

### ðŸ”’ Security
- **Never commit your Client Secret** to version control
- Use user secrets or environment variables for credentials
- Keep your Client ID public-facing (it's safe to expose)

### ðŸŽµ Spotify Premium
- Full playback requires Spotify Premium subscription
- Free users can only play 30-second previews
- We'll implement fallbacks for free users

### ðŸ“Š Rate Limits
- Spotify API has rate limits (100 requests per minute)
- We'll implement proper rate limiting in the code

### ðŸ§ª Development Mode
- Development mode allows 25 test users
- Perfect for team testing before going live
- No approval needed for basic functionality
